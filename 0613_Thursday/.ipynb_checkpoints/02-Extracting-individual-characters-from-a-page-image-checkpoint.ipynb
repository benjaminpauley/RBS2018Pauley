    "# This is not generally why we do OCR... #\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually want to perform OCR on page images so that we can get computer-readable text out so that the text can be searched or analyzed. The trainings I produced for working with Thomson's *Sophonisba*, however, were aimed at the typography of the play as much as they were at the text. The code in this notebook uses the coordinates from Tesseract-generated box files to isolate and exrtreact images of individual characters in a page image. In principle, having these images of individual glyphs could facilitate the typographical study of the text. We can use computer vision techniques to try to find individually-identifiable type sorts and look for their recurrence, either within a book or between different books.\n",
