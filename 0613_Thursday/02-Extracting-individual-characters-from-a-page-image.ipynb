    "# This is not generally why we do OCR... #\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually want to perform OCR on page images so that we can get computer-readable text out so that the text can be searched or analyzed. The trainings I produced for working with Thomson's *Sophonisba*, however, were aimed at the typography of the play as much as they were at the text. The code in this notebook uses the coordinates from Tesseract-generated box files to isolate and exrtreact images of individual characters in a page image. In principle, having these images of individual glyphs could facilitate the typographical study of the text. We can use computer vision techniques to try to find individually-identifiable type sorts and look for their recurrence, either within a book or between different books.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Note: If you are running this notebook in the virtual machine for the course, make sure you're working in the `images` virtual environment (`workon images`). If you are not working in the course's virtual machine, you'll need to have the `Pillow` package installed (`pip install pillow`, assuming you have `pip` installed). The repo at GitHub also includes a standalone Python script that you can run at the command line, providing as arguments an input directory of TIFF/box pairs and an output directory for the resulting glyphs, e.g. `python letters.py -i path/to/tiff/box/pairs/ -o path/to/glyph/output`.\\]"
