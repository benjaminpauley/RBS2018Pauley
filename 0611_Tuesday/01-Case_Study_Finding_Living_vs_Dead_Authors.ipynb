    "# Repurposing MARC data for analysis #\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[This notebook dives right into a fairly involved exercise that draws on a prior discussion of some programmimg fundamentals like data structures, variables, conditionals, and loops. For a hands-on review of those fundamentals using MARC data for the examples, see notebooks A and B. It also presumes that you're already reasonably conversant with the nature of MARC data. Your folder of handouts includes a MARC cheat sheet that might come in handy.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "MARC records are meant to provide information for presentation to users of library catalogs, but they include information that could be used to answer all sorts of potentialy interesting questions. In this example, I want to look at a group of MARC records from the English Short Title Catalogue associated with William Bowyer to see how many of the titles he printed were written by living authors and how many were re-publications of works by dead authors. We'll use a Python script to read our MARC records, perform some basic analysis, and then export the results to a .csv file that we can import into a program like Excel for graphing. (We'll also generate a primitive chart using Python, so we can see results right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of this analysis is a very simple mathematical comparison. To figure out whether an author was alive or dead when a title was published, we'll need to compare the publication year with the year of the author's death. If the author's death year is greater than the publication year, the author died after the book was published. If the death year is less than the publication year, the author died before the book was published. (If the author's death year is equal to the publication year, we have an ambiguous result: perhaps the book was published shortly before the author's death, perhaps it was published after the author's death in order to capitalize on revived notoriety. Without more precise dating, we can't be sure.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But even this simple mathematical comparison requires some finagling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publication year ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on the date in the imprint statement (MARC 260|c), which can take various forms (e.g. roman numerals, prefixed with phrases like \"Printed in the year,\" etc.), we'll look to the MARC 008 control field for the publication year. This is a fixed-length field that reports structured information about the record, with different character positions reserved for different pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we're going to ignore some of the potential complexities that could come up when working with the 008 field. There can be different kinds of dates, for instance (single dates, date ranges, questionable dates, etc.), and the nature of the date(s) provided is communicated by character 6. For our purposes, we're going to treat the first date in the MARC 008 field as the publication date, plain and simple. Uncertainty about a date can also be communicated by giving a partial date with \"u\" in place of the uncertain digits (\"169u\" would mean some time in the 1690s, for instance). It just so happens that there are no \"u\"s in our sample set, but this problem could require further condition testing and logic if we were trying to do this kind of work on a larger set of MARC records.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author's dates ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The author's dates are available in MARC 100|d, but present some challenges. Dates typically take the form of two four-digit numbers separated by a hyphen and followed by a period (e.g. \"1660-1734.\") But that's not always the case. Sometimes we know only the author's birth date (e.g., \"b. 1660\"), sometimes only the death date (e.g., \"d. 1734\"). Sometimes we don't know precise dates (e.g., \"1660 or 61 - 1734\" or \"ca. 1660 - 1734\" or \"1720 - ca. 1778\"), sometimes we only know the dates the author was active as a writer, but not the dates of his or her birth or death (e.g., \"fl. 1763-1770\"). So we'll need to do some work first just to determine whether a date is usable for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that, while we recognize the (many, variable) forms of information in MARC 100|d as years, the contents of the field are, from the computer's point of view, simply strings of texts rather than numbers that can be computed. We'll need to convert strings to integers in order to do the arithmetic to see if the author was living or dead in the year of publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dealing with uncertainties ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we're going to disregard some nuances of our MARC data, we're not going to be totally reckless: for one reason or another, not all of the records we'll be analyzing will provide a clear answer to the question we're asking. The least we can do is keep track of how many records we've excluded from our analysis and gather some information about them so that we can scrutinize our preliminary results and identify potential issues we'd need to look at more closely. As we process these records, we'll keep track not just of the results we can classify as either living or dead, we'll also keep track of the records we can't do anything with: records for which there's no author given; records for which the author field doesn't have a date field; and records for which the available dates don't allow us to judge whether the author was living or dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques in this exercise ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in this relatively simple case, we'll have to do several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conditional checks to learn about the contents of fields before we do anything with them.\n",
    "* String operations (including regular expressions) to find and extract portions of the fields that we need.\n",
    "* Data type conversion to turn strings into integers\n",
    "* Math operations to compare different values\n",
    "* Working with a variety of variables, including integers and dictionaries, to keep track of our results\n",
    "* Exporting our results to a file.\n",
    "* Representing (some of) our data in a simple chart.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Notes ##\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all sorts of caveats that go along with trying to use MARC records this way, and I could list several potential problems with the analysis in this example. One big one is the fact that the ESTC record isn't a uniform unit of measure: some authors may be over-counted in this exercise because there could be multiple ESTC records representing different cataloged variants of what are really the same edition. (I know for sure that happens with Thomson's *Sophonisba*, for instance.) So, while this exercise shows how to munge the data from MARC records, there are always going to be more substantive questions that you'll need to ask about the data you're looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this example was written to break things down into a series of relatively small steps and to prioritize clarity. If you've worked with Python before, you'll probably see things that could be done more elegantly and with fewer lines of code.    "
