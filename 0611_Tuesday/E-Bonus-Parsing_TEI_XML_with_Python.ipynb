    "BeautifulSoup is tool for working with HTML and XML more generally, as we can see be poking around at the text of Thomson's *Sophonisba*, encoded as TEI-XML as part of the ECCO-TCP project. (We'll do more in-depth text analysis using R rather than Python, but I provide these examples for those who anticipate using Python to work with XML sources.)\n",

    "Again, you'll need to know about the structure of your document before you go to work on it this way. If you're working with cleanly-structured data, parsing the XML should be relatively straightforward. Textual sources (like the TEI-encoded texts from the Text Creation Partnership), however, aren't always \"cleanly-structured data.\" (They're trying to represent early printed texts faithfully, and that's sometimes messay). In the examples below, I've had to code around some quirks in the ECCO-TCP text of Thomson's *Sophonisba*. \n",
