(We'll do more in-depth text analysis using R rather than Python, but I provide these examples for those who anticipate using Python to work with XML sources.)\n",

If you're working with cleanly-structured data, parsing the XML should be relatively straightforward. Textual sources (like the TEI-encoded texts from the Text Creation Partnership), however, aren't always \"cleanly-structured data.\" (They're trying to represent early printed texts faithfully, and that's sometimes messay). In the examples below, I've had to code around some quirks in the ECCO-TCP text of Thomson's *Sophonisba*. "
