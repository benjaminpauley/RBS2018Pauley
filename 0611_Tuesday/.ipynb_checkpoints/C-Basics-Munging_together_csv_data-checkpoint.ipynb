    "It's very common to see tabular or field-based data (pretty much anything you could imagine putting in a spreadsheet) distributed in the form of .csv or .tsv (comma- or tab-separated value) files. While you can open these delimited files with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft's Excel, they are simply plain-text files, which means they can be opened by any text editor, making them lightweight and platform-independent: perfect for data interchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to start with two different .csv files that have different pieces of information we want about some of the same books. The first file is the .csv with ESTC bibliographic data about books printed by William Bowyer (which you exported from MarcEdit). The second file provides metadata for TEI-encoded texts created as part of the ECCO-TCP (Text Creationship Partnership) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file has something that the other doesn't. The ESTC file lets us know which eighteenth-century books were printed by Bowyer but doesn't give us any information about how to get the text. The TCP metadata file tells us how to get the text, but doesn't tell us anything about which texts were printed by Bowyer. But both files include some common data--crucially, an ESTC citation number--that we can use to connect the two sets of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll read the file of Bowyer-connected ESTC records to get their ESTC numbers, look for those ESTC numbers in the file of TCP metadata, and produce a new file that adds a TCP identifer to our ESTC metadata.\n",
